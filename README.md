# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing company, has requested the analysis of the company's 2019 ride-sharing fares data by city type, i.e., urban, suburban, and rural. Utilizing Pandas and Matplolib, the weekly fares data from January to April has been compiled into a multiple-line graph. This analysis will be utilized by PyBer for necessary decision making.

## Results: 
There are only 125 rides and 78 Drivers in Rural area from Jan to April 2019
There are 625 rides and 490 Drivers in Suburban area from Jan to April 2019.
There are 1625 rides and 2045 Drivers in Uban area from Jan to April 2019
Because need are lower in Rural area ,The average fare per ride and Driver are higher.
The lowest fares per ride and drivers are in Urban areas, where there are significantly more drivers and people requesting rides.  

These results are shown in the table below:

## Summary:
I would suggest some of these business ideas,
- Increase fare price in Urban cities, so the drivers make more
- Increase number of drivers in Rural areas to decrease fare prices
- Increase driver pay in Urban areas to keep up with Rural
